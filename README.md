**Overview**<br>
The main objective of this tutorial is to provide the complete understanding of gender identification using Machine Learning toolkit (scikit-learn). In this tutorial, we are going to use the structured dataset about male and female. The dataset consists of set of input attributes (Height, Weight, Hair Length, Beard, Scarf) and ouput attribute (Male, Female). The task is to predict male and female from input attributes using Machine Learning algorithms. <br><br>
**Machine Learning Approach:** <br>The problem of Gender Identication is treated as a supervised learning approach because we going to use the labelled dataset.<br><br> **The Input and Output are:**<br>
<b> - Input:</b> Set of Attributes (Height, Weight, Hair Length, Beard, Scarf))<br>
<b> - Output:</b> Gender (Male/Female)<br>
<b> - Goal:</b> Learn from Input to predict Output<br>
    
<h3> Three Phases of Machine Learning: </h3><br>
<b>1. Training Phase </b>– Learn from Training Dataset.<br>
<b>2. Testing/Validation/Evaluation Phase</b> – Evaluate how well the algorithm learned.<br>
<b>3. Application Phase</b>– Use your learned/trained models in real world application.<be>

<h2>PHASE 1 & 2: TRAINING AND TESTING </h2>

**Step 1:** Import Libraries<br><br>
**Step 2:** Read, Understand and Pre-process Train/Test Data<br><br>
**Step 2.1:** Read Data<br><br>
**Step 2.2:** Understand Data<br><br>
**Step 2.3:** Pre-process Data<br><br>
**Step 3:** Label Encoding for Train/Test Data<br><br>
**Step 4:** Feature Extraction – Changing Representation of features “from String to Feature-Vector”<br><br>
**Step 5:** Train Machine Learning Algorithms using Training Data<br><br>
**Step 6:** Evaluate Machine Learning Algorithms using Test Data<br><br>
**Step 7:** Selection of Best Model<br><br>


<h2> PHASE 3: APPLICATION PHASE</h2><br>
  
**Step 8:** Application Phase<br><br>
**Step 8.1:** Combine Dataset (Train + Test )¶<br><br>
**Step 8.2:** Train Best Model (see Step 7) on all data(Train+Test)<br><br>
**Step 8.3:** Save the Trained Model in Pickle File<br><br>
**Step 9:** Make predictions on unseen/new data<br><br>
**Step 9.1:** Load the Trained Model (saved in Step 8.3)<br><br>
**Step 9.2:** Take Input from User<br><br>
**Step 9.3:** Convert User Input into Feature Vector (Same as Feature Vector of Trained Model)<br><br>
**Step 9.4:** Apply Trained Model on Feature Vector of Unseen Dataset and Output Prediction (Male/Female) to User
